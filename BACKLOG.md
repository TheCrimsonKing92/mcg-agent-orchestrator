# Backlog

Follow-up work items. Each entry is self-contained: act on it without prior conversation context. When an item is finished, remove the entry and note the closing commit in DOGFOOD_LOG.md or the commit message. Check this file before proposing new follow-up work.

## Decision record (durable context, not work items)

Merge policy auto-ff on `acceptance` (2026-06-10). Qwen Code over codex for qwen models - codex 0.137 removed the chat wire API and its harmony/oss path cannot drive qwen (2026-06-10). Thinking must be disabled via `.qwen/settings.json` `generationConfig.reasoning: false`; Ollama ignores `/no_think` and `/v1` `think:false` but honors `reasoning_effort` (2026-06-10). Optional later phase: native tool loop in `AgentTaskRunner`, and `gpt-oss:20b` for codex `--oss`, if qwen-code reliability disappoints on real tasks.

## Bound refresh-dispatch output for long subscription logs

Status: open | Size: small | Suggested route: scoped Developer task

Why: goal 2c8af0da (2026-06-11) completed successfully, but `refresh-dispatch 1` printed a very large stderr payload because codex echoed the full prompt and a long diff before `tokens used`; the operator output included a `[truncated 350284 chars]` block. Refresh output should preserve decision-changing evidence without flooding the terminal/context.

Where: task rendering for `refresh-dispatch` in the CLI/dashboard reporting path that prints stdout/stderr verification snippets; likely the same formatter that displays `Last verification` and `Verification history`.

Done when: refresh/status views cap stdout/stderr snippets to a small bounded size with an explicit truncation marker and paths to the full log files; tests cover long stdout/stderr display.

Verify: `dotnet test`; a synthetic long-log verification renders bounded output.

## Move subscription-plan projection out of Dashboard.Api

Status: open | Size: large | Suggested route: not local-model work; needs solution-wide refactoring

Why: cost guards moved to `Mcg.AgentOrchestrator.App.CostControl`, but `SubscriptionPromptCostGuard` still calls `DashboardResponseMapper.BuildSubscriptionPlan` and consumes `SubscriptionPlanItemDto`/`SubscriptionPlanModelSummaryDto`, so cost policy still depends on dashboard projection types.

Where: `src/Mcg.AgentOrchestrator.App/CostControl/SubscriptionPromptCostGuard.cs`, `BuildSubscriptionPlan` in `src/Mcg.AgentOrchestrator.App/Dashboard/Api/DashboardResponseMapper.Configuration.cs` (also pulls in OrchestratorHealthInspector).

Done when: subscription-plan building lives in a non-presentation namespace and CostControl no longer references Dashboard.Api types.

Verify: full `dotnet test`; no `Dashboard.Api` usings remain in `CostControl/`.

## Validate the 768-token routine paid output cap

Status: open, blocked on data | Size: small per run | Suggested route: Simple local-model report tasks; operator embeds the data

Why: the cap (`RoutinePaidProviderFallbackMaxOutputTokens` in `src/Mcg.AgentOrchestrator.Core/Application/AgentTaskRunner.cs`) has never been exercised - the 2026-06-10 inventory found zero API execution records. Data points from loop Reviewer/report tasks: 851, 988, 1010, 1139 output tokens; qwen is verbose, so collect more before tuning.

Done when: roughly ten local API runs across task shapes have recorded token usage and stop reasons; then decide keep/raise with the evidence and record the decision in DOGFOOD_LOG.md.

Verify: execution records in goal evidence show usage and stop reasons; `OutputTokenLimit.IsHit` flags none falsely.
