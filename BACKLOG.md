# Backlog

Follow-up work items. Each entry is self-contained: act on it without prior conversation context. When an item is finished, remove the entry and note the closing commit in DOGFOOD_LOG.md or the commit message. Check this file before proposing new follow-up work.

## Decision record (durable context, not work items)

Merge policy auto-ff on `acceptance` (2026-06-10). Qwen Code over codex for qwen models - codex 0.137 removed the chat wire API and its harmony/oss path cannot drive qwen (2026-06-10). Thinking must be disabled via `.qwen/settings.json` `generationConfig.reasoning: false`; Ollama ignores `/no_think` and `/v1` `think:false` but honors `reasoning_effort` (2026-06-10). Optional later phase: native tool loop in `AgentTaskRunner`, and `gpt-oss:20b` for codex `--oss`, if qwen-code reliability disappoints on real tasks.


## Add sequential pipeline auto-advance

Status: open | Size: medium-large | Suggested route: five-role goal after the completion and limit-review guards are fixed

Why: a five-role pipeline still requires many operator interventions: dispatch, start, wait, refresh, and repeat per role. Existing safety pieces now classify cost guards, usage limits, role sandboxes, wrapper hangs, and refresh failures well enough to support a guarded auto-run command.

Where: `advance-subscription` or a new `run-goal` style command, task dispatch/start/refresh orchestration, dashboard/API parity if applicable.

Done when: one command walks eligible tasks sequentially: dispatch, start with required confirmations, wait on the exit file/process, refresh, and continue. It stops with concise evidence on failure, human input, limit review, retry-after deferral, or a cost guard that lacks confirmation.

Verify: integration tests cover sequential success and stop conditions for failure, human input, limit review, retry-after, and cost guard. Run full `dotnet test`, then validate on a five-role pipeline.

## Move subscription-plan projection out of Dashboard.Api

Status: open | Size: large | Suggested route: not local-model work; needs solution-wide refactoring

Why: cost guards moved to `Mcg.AgentOrchestrator.App.CostControl`, but `SubscriptionPromptCostGuard` still calls `DashboardResponseMapper.BuildSubscriptionPlan` and consumes `SubscriptionPlanItemDto`/`SubscriptionPlanModelSummaryDto`, so cost policy still depends on dashboard projection types.

Where: `src/Mcg.AgentOrchestrator.App/CostControl/SubscriptionPromptCostGuard.cs`, `BuildSubscriptionPlan` in `src/Mcg.AgentOrchestrator.App/Dashboard/Api/DashboardResponseMapper.Configuration.cs` (also pulls in OrchestratorHealthInspector).

Done when: subscription-plan building lives in a non-presentation namespace and CostControl no longer references Dashboard.Api types.

Verify: full `dotnet test`; no `Dashboard.Api` usings remain in `CostControl/`.
